# ITI_Embedded_ARM_Playground

## Introduction
This repository contains my work in Embedded Firmware Development for STM32F401CC ARM CORTEX-M4-based microcontrollers as part of the Advanced Embedded Software Development course taught by Eng. [Ahmed Kishk](https://github.com/Mavrios) in Information Technology Institute (ITI)'s 9-month Professional Training Program --- Embedded Systems Track.

## Overview
The contents of this repository consist of the following:
1. Full-feature MCAL firmware drivers.
2. User-friendly HAL drivers based on the MCAL drivers mentionedabove.
3. CMake scripts/files for compiling, flashing, and debugging STM32F401CC MCUs.
4. RCC Prescaler Python calculator.
